				In the summer of 2020, I had the privilege of interning at DeepTalk as a Mobile Application Developer. The company’s signature product is its AI being able to generate automated notes off of what was said by its users in a voice call. As an intern, I was tasked to create a mobile application alongside another intern from scratch. My job was to develop the back-end of the app while he did the front-end.
				The internship proved to be challenging as it demanded me to learn React Native, which I wasn’t previously familiar with. I also never learned React.js, so I also had to learn the JSX syntax. After plenty of reading, I first started by figuring out how to record audio in a React Native application and then send that data to a server. I learned about npmjs.com to find different libraries useful for my application. After a lot of testing, I finally found the one I needed and proceeded to develop the recording side of the app. Once I got that working, I had to integrate my work with the front-end portion that my peer had created, which took me a while because I used a class component while he used a functional one. What I ended up doing was putting my work in a separate file and creating a context such that the same live recording session would be universal to all screens of the app. After that, I even created some UI components for one of the screens.
				This experience was my first real programming experience with a company. My coworkers were very friendly and welcoming, I learned a lot, and had an enjoyable time. Experiences like these make me look forward to other ones in the future.
