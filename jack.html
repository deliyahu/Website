				In Fall Quarter 2020, I took a Geometric Computer Graphics Course, a class about applying concepts from calculus and linear algebra to computer graphics. Our professor gave us different coding projects every week, each depending on what we learned in class. We used OpenGL to create computer graphics and did so through the use of C++. For our final project, we were allowed to create anything of our choosing based on the concepts we learned in class, which would be graded on technical and artistic merit. For this, I thought it would be fun to create a 3D Model of a fictional character I liked, and I thought Jack Skellington was perfect because of his design.
