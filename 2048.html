				In my first Winter Quarter of UCSD, I took an introduction to programming course in Java. During the third week of class, we were given two weeks to completely develop a running version of the 2048 game, which would be played in a Linux terminal.
			</p>
			<p>
				What I did was develop a 4x4 grid of the game to start with which would randomly generate two numbers, either a 2 or a 4, on a random tile in the grid. Then, I made methods to move the numbers on the grid left, right, up, or down depending on the arrow key pressed, and respectively generating a new number on an empty tile on the grid, combining any like numbers, and incrementing the score if necessary. In order to move the numbers around on the grid, I essentially created a Bubble Sort algorithm (this was before I took a class on other, more efficient sorting algorithms) to sort the numbers from least to greatest depending on the arrow key pressed. Then, after I created the Linux terminal version of 2048, our professor tasked us to create a JavaFX user interface for the game using what we originally developed as a back-end.
			</p>
			<p>
				The project was fun and interesting since it used a real-world example of a popular game to demonstrate beginner programming concepts learned in class, which even went as far as to help me in future classes as well by teaching me Bubble Sort.
