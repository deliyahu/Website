				After KSDT, I found another student organization to be a part of, this time a student-run fashion magazine. They needed someone to design a new website, so I decided to join them and do just that.
			</p>
			<p>
				When I first started, I had a senior member of TREND supervise me and teach me about Figma before I did anything. Then, they showed me previous versions of their website and encouraged me to make something new and original. Over time, I used Figma to make my own versions of the website and they would usually give me feedback until they gave me their final word of approval.
			</p>
			<p>
				Being at TREND was an interesting experience, even though I never used any of my programming skills, I liked learning about design and working in a team once more.

				Skills Used: Figma
