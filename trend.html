				After KSDT, I found another student organization to be a part of, this time a student-run fashion magazine. They needed someone to design a new website, so I decided to join them and do just that.
				When I first started, I had a senior member of TREND supervise me and teach me about Figma before I did anything. Then, they showed me previous versions of their website and encouraged me to make something new and original. Over time, I used Figma to make my own versions of the website and they would usually give me feedback until they gave me their final word of approval.
				Being at TREND was an interesting experience, even though I never used any of my programming skills, I liked learning about design and working in a team once more.
