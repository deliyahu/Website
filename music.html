				In the beginning of 2019, a close friend and I loved talking about music and what songs we listened to at the time. One of the issues we had was discovering new music. The platform I primarily used to listen to music was Spotify, and I read that they had a Spotify Web API for developers to make web applications using user information, so as a personal project I decided to make a web app that recommended music based on what a user listened to.
				To do this, I had to learn about OAuth and how to ask for a user’s permission to use the application, and then make API calls to give the user music recommendations based on what they listen to on their account. I implemented OAuth in my application using an example from Spotify and making my own version fitted to the application, and I made API calls by using jQuery. The app works by providing the user a list of the artists they listen to the most frequently during the past 6 months of Spotify user activity. For each artist the user listens to, the app would go through similar artists on Spotify and recommend the user one their albums. Once I was finished with the project, I deployed the web application using HerokuApp, and is available on 
				<a href="http://music-recommendation-tool.herokuapp.com/">http://music-recommendation-tool.herokuapp.com/</a>.
				I loved doing this project because I enjoyed applying my programming skills to one of my hobbies being listening and playing music. Additionally, this project was the first experience I had with JavaScript and jQuery and taught me a lot about what I know now today.
